### Node.js typescript framework for large application

- Express consists of JavaScript, which makes it vulnerable to type definitions.

- That's why we avoid supersets with starter packages that introduce TypeScript.

- The package is configured to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript.

### Commands supported
- Run the server in development mode: npm run start:dev
- Check for linting errors: npm run lint.
- Build the project for production: npm run build.
- Run the production build: npm start.
- Run production build with a different env file npm start -- --env="name of env file" (default is production).
